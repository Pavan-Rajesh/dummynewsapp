                The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell

            </h4>
            <p>
                After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020,
                PayPal is finally allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital
                assets between PayPal and other <a href="#" class="middle-link">wallets and exchanges</a>
                wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature
                is available to select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all eligible U.S. users in
                the coming weeks.

            </p>
            <p>
                The first batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin

                        class="money-unit">LTC</span>$74.58</a>
                In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via
                Checkout at millions of merchant terminals. The company has been granted a full
                Bitlicense by the New York Department of Financial Services for the conduct.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of
                the application to start transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a
                one-time ID verification before the procedure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on
                their respective blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such
                fees. To protect users' privacy, the firm generates a new recipient address for each
                transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not charge fees for incoming
                transfers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services,
                such as central bank digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also
                exploring the possibility of launching its own stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The
                discovery came after a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin within the
                source code of the company's iPhone app.

                Crypto traders in Italy will be subject to a 26% capital-gains tax starting in 2023,
                according to a new budget that won parliamentary approval on Thursday.
                Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget – which was
                completed in a rush before the end of the year – features 21 billion euros ($22.3

                budget
                legitimizes
                crypto assets by defining them as "a digital representation of value or rights, which
                can be transferred and stored electronically, using the technology of distributed

            </p>
            <p>
                The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax
                period. As an incentive for declaring crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute
                income tax" for investors at 14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023,
                instead of the cost at the time of purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the new rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from
                profits and be carried forward.
                Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what qualifies as a
                taxable event as the document also says, "the exchange between crypto assets
                having same characteristics and functions," doesn't constitute a "fiscal case."

                Saylor said in an <a href="https://youtu.be/BiTc3tkrcEw?t=2" class="middle-link">interview</a> last
                week:
                <br>
                The most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the institutional
                grade digital asset and the clarity that … there is one crypto asset that’s a digital
                commodity … Bitcoin is that commodity.

                2022 has been a rough and tough year for investors, traders, cryptocurrency
                businesses, and miners in general. The prolonged bear market, exacerbated by a
                series of catastrophic events, posed a threat to miners.
            </h4>
            <p>
                Miners were dealing with a variety of issues, including defaulted loans, quarterly
                losses, and soaring bitcoin hash rates that reached all-time highs. All these factors
                were affecting the profitability of the miners and were causing sell pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The situation was aggravated when cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin’s,
                plummeted. Bitcoin, which was hovering around $48,000 last year, hit a low of
                $15,590 by the end of 2022. According to the data collected from The Block, bitcoin
                miners’ revenue hit $9.55 billion in 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bitcoin miners’ revenue dropped in 2022
                Bitcoin, which is trading at $16,721 at press time, has been on a downward spiral
                alongside other cryptocurrencies. The falling cryptocurrency prices had a major
                effect on the income and profits of miners. Even though the $9.55 billion in revenue
                in 2022 seems like a large number, it is comparatively lower than that of 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the course of 2021, bitcoin miners made more thqan $15 billion in revenue,
                according to the data from the block. This was actually considered to be a 206%
                year-over-year increase.
